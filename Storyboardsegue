The following calls the segue, if you dont' have a button link directly to the next Viewcontroller
            
            [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@"Measure" sender:self];
        
TO pass varibles to next view Controller, do the following pattern



          - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
          {
              if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@"New"])
              {
                  NewAppLeadViewController *leadViewWhatsnew = segue.destinationViewController;
                  leadViewWhatsnew.leadTypeNum=0;
              }else if([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@"Measure"]){
                  NewAppLeadViewController *leadViewHowToMeasure = segue.destinationViewController;;
                  leadViewHowToMeasure.leadTypeNum = 2;
              }
          }
          
          
          
well this code actually help me clearfied when exactly I should use segue to pass a varible.

it seems to me that passing a certain state is a good idea to use segue
while passing say..data should probably use something else like a delegate 
it is probalby to unit test it that way
