# how to mix them

# example In App Delegate.  name of stordboard is Introduction, identifier have to manually input to the first controller


       UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Introduction" bundle:nil];
       UIViewController *vc = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"viewController"];
       self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
       self.window.rootViewController = vc;
       
       UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Introduction" bundle:nil];
       UIViewController *vc = [sb instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"myViewController"];
       vc.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal;
       [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:NULL];
       
       
       
 Is almost exactly like Swift.
 
 # inside storyboard
 
       don't forget to embeded in navigation viewcontroller or else you will have to manually write the transtions animations
