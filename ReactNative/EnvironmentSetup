Purpose:
  setup React for iOS and Andriod in Mac
  setup ESLint (bug checking for javascript)


Dependencies needed

  1. xcode

  2. homeBrew - use to install Node

  3. Node/NPM - runs javascript outside of the brower.
              - NPM is used for installing and managing dependencies
              - Node and NPM come together
  4. watchman  - watch files on the hard drive and waits for them to change
 
  5. RN CLI  - React native Command Line Interface. Used to generate new React native projects.
  
  
 
 Step 1. Install/update xcode
 Step 2. Install homebrew https://brew.sh/  "/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
"
 Step 3. Install node - first check "node -v" if you installed it previously if not "brew install node"
 step 4. install watchman - facebook program to watch harddeive changes "brew install watchman"
          -this step might take a while-
          
 step 5. install react  npm install -g react-native-cli

          fix above by adding "sudo" 
          "sudo npm install -g react-native-cli"
          
 step 6. start a project.
           1. create a folder where you want to start your project and cd to it.
           2  react-native init [name]  example: "react-native init albums"   //create project named albums
           
           3. errors again

                      To run your app on iOS:
                         cd /Users/ericyu423/Desktop/ReactNative/Projs/albums
                         react-native run-ios
                         - or -

                         cd /Users/ericyu423/Desktop/ReactNative/Projs/albums
                         Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected
                         react-native run-android

           4 brew install yarn
           5. 2nd try: react-native init albums
           
           
    step 6. go to albums proj directory run simulator
    
         a. react-native run-ios //run on ios simulator  (this take a while)
         
         b. react-native run-android // this will not work additional setups are needed
              step a. open andriod studio 
                   b. open existing proj
                   c. go to alumbs project folder (or where the react proj fold u just created)
                   d. open the andriod folder
                     error: missing platform
                     click on the blue link and andriod will automatically install and update what is needed
                     
                     you will see another error in andriod studio.

         c. now setup the emulator that we can use     
          andriod studio -> tool -> android -> avd manager -> create an andriod device -> select default 5.2" Nexus 5x
          
          select OS api 24 ...lowest recommanded version
          
          done setup -> Nexus 5X API 24 -> run emulator click on > button

          e. cd /Users/ericyu423/Library/Android/sdk
          add path

             adb kill-server
             
             your virtual device -> whip data in andriod 
             
             
          finally: go back to the proj folder /albums and type react-native run-android (works now)
