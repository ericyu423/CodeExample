clang/link error
Xcode

1. read the error message, delete simulator files might fix this
2. if using cocopods, delete podlock and pod folder and reinstall podfile
3. when updating cocopods old branches might have old linter files, go to build setting and delete them all and merge with the 
    updated branch can cure it.

                in my case crahlytic is blocks and the app will just keep try to load itself.
